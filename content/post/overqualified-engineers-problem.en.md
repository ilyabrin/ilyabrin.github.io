The Russian IT market faces a paradox: companies complain about talent shortage while experienced engineers can't find jobs. The problem isn't lack of skills - it's too many of them.

Let me share my thoughts on why this happens and what overqualified engineers can do.

## The Current State

### What I Observe

The Russian programming community has changed dramatically:

- **Knowledge inflation**: Everyone knows "modern stack" - React, Go, Kubernetes, microservices
- **Experience devaluation**: 10 years of experience doesn't guarantee employment
- **Junior market saturation**: Bootcamp graduates flood entry positions
- **Senior paradox**: Companies want seniors but can't afford them or fear they'll leave

Real situation from my network:

> **Russian IT Market Today:**
>
> - Junior positions: 1000+
> - Junior applicants: 10000+
> - Senior positions: ~100
> - Senior applicants: 5000+
> - Average salary: decreasing
> - Competition: global

### The Knowledge Problem

Russian developers often have:

- Strong theoretical foundation (thanks to education system)
- Deep understanding of algorithms and data structures
- Experience with complex systems
- Multiple technology stacks

But the market wants:

- Fast delivery
- Specific framework knowledge
- "Culture fit"
- Willingness to work for local salaries

## The Overqualification Trap

### Why Companies Reject Seniors

#### 1. Budget Constraints

Company logic:

- Candidate experience > 7 years?
- Expected salary: ~300k RUB
- Our budget: 150k RUB
- Verdict: "overqualified"

They assume you're too expensive before asking.

#### 2. Fear of Boredom

"You'll get bored with our tasks and leave in 3 months."

Translation: "We have legacy code and no interesting challenges."

#### 3. Management Insecurity

Junior team lead (3 years exp) interviewing senior (15 years exp):

*If candidate experience > interviewer experience:*

- **Status:** rejected
- **Reason:** "not a culture fit"
- **Real reason:** "threatens my position"

#### 4. Overengineering Fear

"Seniors overcomplicate everything."

Sometimes true, but often an excuse.

### The CV Dilemma

Should you hide experience? Remove projects? Pretend to be junior?

**Bad idea:**

*Fake CV:*

- Company: "Startup X"
- Experience: 2 years
- Role: "Middle Developer"
- *(Hidden: 10 years at major companies)*

Why it fails:

- You'll be caught during interview
- Salary expectations won't match
- You'll hate the work level
- Ethical issues

## What Actually Works

### 1. Niche Specialization

Don't be "full-stack developer." Be:

- "Go performance optimization specialist"
- "PostgreSQL scaling expert"
- "Legacy system migration consultant"
- "Kubernetes security architect"

Comparison:

**Generic profile (bad):**

- Skills: Go, Python, JS, Docker, Kubernetes...
- Result: lost among thousands of similar profiles

**Specialized profile (good):**

- Core expertise: "High-load Go systems"
- Proven results: "Reduced latency 10x", "Saved $100k/year"
- Niche: "Fintech backends"

### 2. Consulting & Contracting

Stop looking for full-time employment. Offer:

- **Code audits**: "I'll review your Go codebase - 50k RUB"
- **Architecture consulting**: "I'll design your system - 100k RUB"
- **Performance optimization**: "I'll fix your bottlenecks - 150k RUB"
- **Team mentoring**: "I'll train your developers - 80k RUB/month"

Advantages:

- Higher hourly rate
- Multiple income sources
- No "overqualification" problem
- Flexibility

### 3. Product Development

Build your own products and diversify income:

**Independent engineer income sources:**

- Own products (SaaS, tools)
- Consulting clients
- Content (blog, YouTube, courses)
- **Total:** sum of all sources

Examples:

- SaaS tools for developers
- Open source with sponsorship
- Technical courses
- Developer tools

### 4. International Remote Work

Russian salary ceiling doesn't apply globally:

**Salary comparison:**

| Market        | Senior Developer  | In USD  |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Russia        | 250,000 RUB/month | ~$2,700 |
| International | $8,000/month      | $8,000  |

Platforms:

- Upwork (start with lower rates, build reputation)
- Toptal (if you pass screening)
- Gun.io
- Direct outreach to foreign companies

### 5. Teaching & Content

Your experience is valuable:

- **Technical blog**: Share real problems and solutions
- **YouTube channel**: Code reviews, architecture discussions
- **Online courses**: Udemy, your own platform
- **Corporate training**: Companies pay well for team training
- **Mentorship**: 1-on-1 coaching for developers

**Content creator revenue model:**

- Blog → ads, sponsors
- Courses → direct sales
- Consulting → from audience
- Speaking → conferences
- Sponsorships → companies

*Realistic income:*

- After 1 year: 100-300k RUB/month (~$1,100-3,300)
- After 2-3 years: 300-500k+ RUB/month (~$3,300-5,500+)

### 6. Fractional CTO/Architect

Many startups need senior guidance but can't afford full-time:

- Work with 3-5 startups simultaneously
- 1-2 days per week each
- Strategic decisions, architecture, code reviews
- 80-150k RUB per startup/month

Total: 240-750k RUB/month

## Practical Steps

### Month 1: Positioning

#### 1. Define your niche

- What are you truly expert at?
- What problems can you solve better than 95% of developers?

#### 2. Document your expertise

- Case studies
- Metrics and results
- Testimonials

#### 3. Build online presence

- LinkedIn (English + Russian)
- GitHub (showcase projects)
- Personal site

### Month 2-3: Outreach

**Consulting:**

- Contact 50 companies with specific audit offers
- Offer free initial consultation
- Convert 2-5% to paid clients

**Content:**

- Publish 8 technical articles
- Start YouTube channel
- Engage in communities

**Networking:**

- Attend meetups
- Speak at conferences
- Help others publicly

### Month 4-6: Scale

- Raise rates as demand grows
- Automate what you can
- Build passive income streams
- Create systems, not just trade time

## Mindset Shift

Stop thinking like employee:

| Old mindset            | New mindset                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "I need a job"         | "I solve specific problems for money" |
| "I'm overqualified"    | "I'm specialized and premium-priced"  |
| "Companies reject me"  | "I'm selective about clients"         |
| "I need stable salary" | "I need diversified income"           |

## Real Numbers

From my network (anonymized):

**Engineer A** (12 years exp):

- Was: Senior at company, 200k RUB/month
- Now: 3 consulting clients + course, 450k RUB/month

**Engineer B** (15 years exp):

- Was: Unemployed 6 months, "overqualified"
- Now: Fractional CTO for 4 startups, 520k RUB/month

**Engineer C** (10 years exp):

- Was: Rejected from 30+ positions
- Now: Technical content + Upwork, 380k RUB/month

## Conclusion

The overqualification problem is real, but it's also an opportunity.

You don't need to:

- Hide your experience
- Accept junior positions
- Work for unfair compensation

You need to:

- Reposition yourself
- Create your own opportunities
- Think like business, not employee
- Leverage your expertise differently

The Russian IT market is changing. Traditional employment isn't the only path anymore. Maybe it's not even the best path.

Your experience is valuable. You just need to package and sell it differently.

## What's Next?

Start today:

1. Pick one strategy from above
2. Commit to 3 months
3. Track results
4. Adjust and iterate

The market doesn't owe you a job. But you don't owe the market your undervalued labor either.

Build your own path.
